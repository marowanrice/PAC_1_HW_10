postfix calculator

GRADE: 10/10

The purpose of this lab is to design a program to implement a calculator, but there is a
difference this time around: the calculator will first perform an infix to postfix conversion
and then evaluate the resulting postfix expression.

You should implement the calculator in two parts:

A Converter class that will convert the input string to postfix expression. 
  The purpose of the Converter class is to take an infix expression that is generated by
the user, and convert it to a postfix expression that can be evaluated using code.

A Calculator class that will evaluate the postfix expression.
  The Calculator class will instantiate an object of the Converter class in order to
have the infix expression converted to a postfix expression.
